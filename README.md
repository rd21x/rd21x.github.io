## Introduction

Society has undoubtedly entered the fourth industrial revolution, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) recognised as a pivotal force for human flourishing throughout the 21st century. Many equate AI's transformative potential to discoveries like fire, electricity, and the internet. The recent rapid progression of AI is heralding a new era of technological advancement with significant implications for global economies, national security, and societal norms. AI is reshaping industries, governance, and everyday life with unprecedented speed and scope. As this technology advances, it is crucial to understand its broad-ranging impacts and its potential to redefine global dynamics.

Experts predict that the efficiency enhancements AI brings could lead to the obsolescence of many jobs currently performed by humans. On the other hand, these technological advancements also forge new opportunities. Individuals, organisations, communities, and nations most adept at embracing change stand to gain substantially. Consequently, it is imperative for New Zealand to rapidly develop and implement a comprehensive strategy that capitalises on the potential of AI. This strategy should aim to maximise local benefits, ensuring New Zealand becomes a competitive player in the global AI landscape.

New Zealand finds itself at a pivotal juncture. The transformative potential of AI promises significant economic and societal benefits, enhancing the quality of life for New Zealanders. Yet, this opportunity is coupled with notable challenges, such as data sovereignty, security concerns, and reliance on foreign AI technologies and supply chains, which may compromise national independence and security. Furthermore, adopting AI technologies requires considerable energy inputs, raising critical questions about the sustainability of these advancements and the adequacy of current infrastructures. Standing at the cusp of this significant digital revolution, New Zealand, known for its abundant renewable electricity sources, innovation, and forward-thinking policies, can become a global leader in AI infrastructure and energy-intensive data centre operations, presenting unique opportunities over the coming decade. This strategic expansion would leverage the nation’s energy resources, advanced technological landscape, and stable political climate, driving substantial economic, technological, societal, and environmental benefits.

This thesis will analyse AI's potential impact on New Zealand by drawing on official strategy documents, cases from other regions, and expert opinions. By examining opportunities for leveraging AI as a competitive advantage, assessing data security and foreign dependency risks, and evaluating the energy sector's preparedness for AI-driven demands, this work proposes actionable strategies for harnessing AI to ensure New Zealand's future success. This review also assesses the policy environment, highlighting supports and barriers to becoming a global leader in AI infrastructure. It includes policy recommendations to foster a supportive regulatory environment encouraging investment in renewable infrastructure and technology innovation.

The broader geopolitical landscape will also be considered, including hypothetical scenarios where global conflicts or policy decisions abroad could adversely affect New Zealand's access to AI and computing services. Through a balanced examination of these factors, the thesis aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on how New Zealand can navigate the complexities of the digital era to secure a prosperous and resilient future. Strategic recommendations will be proposed for stakeholders, including policymakers, industry leaders, and technology developers.

## Important Considerations for Computing and AI Users

### The Growing Reliance on Artificial Intelligence: Risks and Implications for New Zealand

As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of life and industry, it brings opportunities and challenges that New Zealand must navigate carefully to harness benefits while mitigating risks. This section details some key risks and explores their potential impact.

**Automation and Job Displacement**

One of the most pressing risks is the potential for significant job displacement caused by automation. AI, including its integration with robotics, will perform many tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans. In some cases, this will result in full automation and the outright elimination of roles. More significant, however, will be the considerable productivity boost many highly skilled workers will receive through incorporating AI into their workflows. This shift is expected to increase unemployment, significantly affecting lower-skilled, repetitive, and clerical jobs.

For example, New Zealand’s large agricultural sector could see significant automation in dairy farming, fruit picking, and other labour-intensive activities. AI-driven technologies like autonomous tractors and robotic milking machines increase efficiency and productivity and reduce the need for traditional labour. The manufacturing sector is undergoing substantial changes with the introduction of AI in automation and robotics. Jobs in assembly lines and production that involve repetitive tasks are particularly vulnerable to automation. AI-driven robots perform tasks precisely and consistently beyond human capabilities, operating around the clock and reducing production costs. Continued advancements in AI-powered autonomous vehicles may put transportation sector workers at risk. AI also optimises logistics and supply chains by predicting and optimising delivery strategies, reducing demand for roles in these sectors. In addition, many administrative tasks, such as data entry, scheduling, and bookkeeping, can be efficiently handled by AI systems, reducing the need for clerical staff in various sectors, including government offices, schools, and private businesses.

The sectors listed above currently employ approximately one million people in New Zealand. All else being equal, a 15% increase in productivity improvement due to AI for these sectors over the coming decade could decrease the demand for human labour by 150,000 people. This is a conservative estimate and only a partial selection of the overall labour market.

Some skills are likely to increase in demand as AI adoption grows. However, roles such as machine learning engineers, data scientists, and advanced analytics are typically highly complex and often require significant experience or advanced university-level education. The increase in these roles will also be significantly fewer than those set to be lost. The net result will likely be considerably fewer traditional job vacancies, resulting in greater welfare, education, and re-skilling demand. We are likely to see increased economic inequality in the medium term.

**Increased Centralisation and Reliance on Offshore Providers**

New Zealand's economy is intricately linked to global markets and dependent on international supply chains and offshore providers for various goods, services, and technologies. While this integration has numerous benefits, it also exposes the country to risks that can affect national resilience and economic security. Over the past decade, we have witnessed increased centralisation due to heavier reliance on advanced software technologies. These risks include over-reliance, bordering on complete dependency, on software providers and platforms like Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

Consequently, much of the global wealth has been centralised in a small number of companies. At the time of writing, Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and Meta (Facebook) were six of the seven most valuable listed companies globally, with a market capitalisation of more than USD 14 trillion (NZD 25 trillion). These companies are all domiciled in the United States, dominate global markets, and are worth more than 60 times New Zealand’s current GDP combined. Notably, they are also the most prominent names in the race for AI dominance.

This issue is not specific to New Zealand; however, given the current geopolitical environment, continuing to consolidate technological and economic reliance on these entities poses a material risk to New Zealand’s critical infrastructure, national security, and sovereignty. Without steps to mitigate this risk, it seems likely that power will continue to be consolidated into a small number of offshore entities over time.

**New Zealand’s Trade Deficit**

New Zealand’s trade balance is critical in shaping the country's long-term economic landscape. It is the difference between the value of a country's exports and imports of goods and services over time, a crucial indicator of a nation's economic health. The trade balance affects the nation’s currency value, economic growth, and financial stability. A persistent trade deficit can result in currency depreciation, national debt accumulation, and long-term dependency on foreign capital.

While utilising centralised AI tools has provided enormous benefits and is essential for technological advancement and integration into the global digital economy, New Zealand's growing dependency on foreign-owned technology and infrastructure exacerbates our position as a net consumer and contributes to an ongoing trade deficit. Payments for foreign technology services, such as software licensing and cloud services, are significant contributors to this imbalance. In 2023, “Telecommunications, Computer, and Information Services” added approximately NZD 1.4 billion, or nearly 20%, to the country’s trade deficit.

The ongoing outflow of capital to offshore providers, such as through software subscription costs, exacerbates this weakness and raises questions about the long-term sustainability of such economic practices amidst broader weakness in export sectors. As AI becomes more entrenched in every aspect of society and the economy, the risk of an ever-increasing trade deficit grows, necessitating reevaluating trade and investment strategies to bolster economic resilience.

**Data Sovereignty and Privacy Risks**

To protect national autonomy and citizens' interests, a continued focus on data privacy and sovereignty is crucial as the quantity and value of data grows. The increasing reliance on AI and digital technologies exacerbates these challenges, especially when data is stored and processed offshore. Data is subject to the country's laws where it is collected or stored. Hosting data in New Zealand ensures it is protected under New Zealand law, whereas offshore data centres expose it to foreign legal interpretations, potentially compromising data security and privacy. Domestic data centres can be perceived as more secure due to national security standards and easier oversight. However, reputable international providers have robust security measures that comply with global standards.

While some argue that physical data centres within a local jurisdiction ensure sufficient data sovereignty, even this may not be adequate for specific workloads, such as matters of national security, government international relations, or military and geopolitical strategies requiring higher protection levels. Foreign entities managing New Zealand's onshore data centres and local services may offer limited privacy and data protection benefits if their home countries' legislations and interests do not align with New Zealand's. Furthermore, the concept of data sovereignty for Māori must be carefully assessed, especially where data is being hosted on services operated by foreign companies, domestically or offshore.

**Distinguishing Different User Bases for Computing and AI Infrastructure**

Not every user has the same threat model and trade-offs to consider when assessing how and where to manage their computing infrastructure. Different user groups typically have distinct requirements and challenges, necessitating different infrastructure solutions.

- **Individual and Family Users**

  Individual users generally require computing and AI services for personal use, such as education, entertainment, or personal data management. Their needs are typically characterised by lower computing power and storage capacity than commercial users. Cloud-based services are popular among individual users due to their affordability and ease of use. Services like Google Drive for storage and cloud-based AI tools like ChatGPT are commonly utilised for personal or hobbyist projects. Users with a technical aptitude and lower tolerance for third-party dependencies can typically self-host their services at home with minimal cost and effort. However, social media, entertainment and communication applications are typically centralised with large global technology providers.

- **Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)**

  SMEs need reliable and scalable computing resources to support day-to-day business operations, including customer data management, financial transactions, and online services. However, they often do not have the resources or desire to invest heavily in IT infrastructure. SMEs frequently turn to managed cloud services and SaaS (Software as a Service) platforms that offer flexibility to scale up or down based on business demands. These services provide a cost-effective way to access advanced computing resources without significant upfront investments. For these users, price and user experience will likely outweigh security and sovereignty concerns in most cases. However, SMEs with large or sensitive datasets or significant computational needs may act more akin to larger entities.

- **Large and Complex Businesses**

  Large businesses with extensive customer datasets require robust, high-performance computing infrastructure to efficiently manage and analyse vast amounts of data. They need high levels of security, data privacy, and system reliability to handle sensitive customer information and support critical business operations. Hybrid cloud environments are often ideal for large enterprises, combining private clouds for sensitive operations with public clouds for scalability and cost-efficiency. Dedicated AI equipment for tasks like machine learning model training and big data analytics are also becoming commonplace. These users will typically assess their vendors, including the infrastructure and hosting of services, in detail through a procurement process and ongoing active service management. Depending on the nature of the business, the legal jurisdiction of vendor and physical data centres may be crucial when choosing their providers.

- **Government Agencies**

  Government agencies use computing and AI infrastructure for critical functions, including public records management, surveillance, law enforcement, and public service delivery. Requirements for data sovereignty, security, and compliance with strict regulatory standards are paramount. Government bodies often opt for private and local cloud solutions to maintain control over their data and meet regulatory requirements. On-premises data centres with enhanced security features are also utilised to ensure data protection and compliance with national laws.

- **Academic and Research Institutions**

  Academic and research institutions require powerful computing capabilities to conduct complex simulations, data analyses, and experimental research. These users need access to cutting-edge technology and high computational throughput to support their research objectives. High-performance and resource-hungry equipment is commonly employed and required in these sectors. Cloud-based research computing platforms that offer massive scalability are increasingly adopted. Securing intellectual property using methods such as strong encryption will be paramount. However, actual datasets are likely to be anonymised or aggregated, meaning privacy and sovereignty issues can be less important.

The diversity of computing and AI infrastructure user groups highlights the need for varied and flexible technological solutions. Providers must tailor their offerings to meet the specific requirements of each user group, ensuring accessibility, scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness.

### Hosting Options

Deciding where and how to deploy AI and data workloads differs for each user and use case. However, some key underlying factors and concepts underpin all decisions. This section briefly describes critical distinguishing factors between deployment models and what users must consider when assessing where and how to run their workloads.

- **Self-Hosting**

  With self-hosting, users purchase and manage their hardware and infrastructure and host it in a fully controlled location, commonly referred to as “on-premises”. This is suitable for users needing dedicated resources, specific performance requirements, and those requiring stringent control over their data. Depending on scale, this model may require significant capital expenditure for hardware and facilities and high operational overheads. Key advantages include maximum control and customisation, enhanced security and compliance, and better privacy and sovereignty assurances. However, significant technical expertise is required, and solutions are less scalable than alternatives.

- **Co-location**

  Co-location is where a third party provides the physical premises, network connectivity, and energy infrastructure required to operate computer equipment, and customers locate their servers inside the data centre. Using this model provides a middle ground between fully self-hosted and cloud computing, providing some efficiency benefits of cloud computing without losing visibility and control of running on somebody else's computers. Co-location is suitable for users requiring secure and reliable infrastructure without the overhead of managing a data centre. Advantages of co-location include enhanced security, reliability, reduced infrastructure costs, and lower capital expenditure than building one's own data centres, but ongoing rental and operational costs will apply. Effective technical redundancy requires duplicating critical components and preparing backup systems in alternative physical locations. This setup helps maintain service availability during planned maintenance and unexpected disasters or hardware failures.

  Several large New Zealand entities offer local data centre space under the co-location model. This option is growing in popularity over time. For example, Spark has a clear strategy to invest in New Zealand's data centre capacity, and building a network of regional data centres is an important part of these plans. It is investing $15 million to buy the University of Waikato’s data centre and roll out a new fibre backbone from Otorohanga to Te Kauwhata. Some of this cost will go towards upgrading the facility to make it a viable “edge” data centre, able to provide lower latency services to nearby business customers. As part of the deal, the university will become an anchor customer in the data centre.

- **Cloud Service Providers**

  Well-known global providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud offer public cloud services. They offer many services on a pay-as-you-go basis, which can optimise costs but may become expensive at scale. This is ideal for users needing rapid scalability and a broad range of services without upfront investment.

  Cloud service providers offer highly available and resilient architecture with multiple global regions, availability zones, and redundancy features, a key benefit of cloud computing designed to eliminate technical single points of failure, thus increasing reliability. This is achieved through redundant storage, network paths, and distributed data processing. Strategies like data replication across multiple availability zones (AZs) and automatic failover mechanisms are commonly used to ensure service continuity. Providers often establish multiple AZs within each cloud region. Each AZ is a separate data centre with power, cooling, and networking, designed to be isolated from failures in other AZs. Having multiple AZs within a single region enhances fault tolerance and supports high availability, allowing continuous service even if one zone experiences an outage.

  In addition, “private cloud” instances are also possible, which logically isolates infrastructure provided by a third party and dedicates it to a single customer. This involves higher costs but can offer highly secure solutions with trusted third parties. Compared to alternatives, a private cloud can offer a good balance of control and flexibility, scalability, reliability, and security. However, compared to other options, relying on these providers offers the least control and fewest assurances around sovereignty issues and compliance concerns. It can also increase the potential for vendor lock-in.

  Microsoft recently announced plans to establish its first data centre region in New Zealand to provide enhanced cloud services across the country and broader region.

  AWS has also expressed interest in expanding its infrastructure in New Zealand, signalling growing international confidence in the local market. In 2021, Amazon announced it would build three interlinked data centres in Auckland to offer its Amazon Web Services (AWS) via a local region. It is estimated to create 1000 new jobs and contribute NZ$10.8 billion (US$7.7 billion) to New Zealand’s Gross Domestic Product.

- **Hybrid Deployments**

  Hybrid deployments combine self-hosted or co-located infrastructure with public cloud services. This balances the cost of private infrastructure with the scalability of the public cloud. It is ideal for users needing flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solutions while allowing for more control and security over sensitive data. However, integration across an environment may be complex, and there is a potential for data latency issues due to traversing multiple unrelated networks.

### Jurisdiction

A key consideration and nuance in designing computing infrastructure involves understanding the legal jurisdictions that can apply in conflict or dispute. New Zealand technology users can benefit from the country’s strong legal protections and data privacy provisions, such as the Privacy Act 2020. However, users should also consider the involvement of foreign entities, especially when utilising cloud service providers. Different scenarios can include:

- **Domestic Hosting with Sovereign or Domestic Ownership and Management**

  This model offers enhanced assurances, reducing legal risk and complexity. Technology is self-hosted, or hosting services (e.g. co-location providers) are wholly owned and managed within the country. This is especially suitable for users with stringent data sovereignty requirements. The main drawback to New Zealanders is that this model significantly restricts the benefits of utilising major global service providers, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.

- **Domestic Hosting with Foreign Ownership or Management**

  Local hosting with foreign control or management balances local hosting benefits, such as data sovereignty concerns, with increased access to popular global services, technologies, and expertise. Prominent examples of this offering include global cloud service providers such as Microsoft setting up data centre regions in New Zealand. This pattern suits users needing advanced capabilities without major concerns about complete data sovereignty and ownership.

  Risks related to foreign control and legal jurisdictions may be theoretical for most users, assuming the absence of well-resourced foreign adversaries or major geopolitical conflicts. Legal abstractions such as data trustees may provide partial mitigation and a barrier to offshore interference. However, practical control becomes paramount when assurance in adversarial environments is required.

  A hypothetical scenario where this model may pose risks is described below. While this represents a “worst-case scenario” from a New Zealand perspective, it should be considered with a non-zero possibility of occurring. It should be noted that sanctions, restrictions, and other adversarial actions are often implemented rapidly and unexpectedly during major conflicts.

  **Scenario:**

  The United States engages in direct military action against China in retaliation for China taking control of Taiwan. Additionally, the United States and NATO impose trade restrictions and sanctions on China, significantly restricting imports and exports. The New Zealand Government is pressured to side with their Five Eyes Security Alliance and NATO allies. Still, it must do so to the detriment of the relationship with the country’s largest trading partner, China. Restricting trade with China would result in immediate and catastrophic impacts on New Zealand’s economy and supply chains, making this an infeasible proposition. New Zealand continues trading with China, weakening geopolitical relationships with the United States and its allies. The relationship between the U.S. and New Zealand further deteriorates when Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are legally compelled to comply with the U.S. Cloud Act or Patriot Act by providing access to data stored on their servers regardless of physical location. Alternatively, the United States sanctions New Zealand as a Chinese ally, resulting in Microsoft, Amazon and Google withdrawing access to all services in and from New Zealand.

- **Offshore Hosting**

  The most common model for traditional and consumer use cases is offshore hosting, which utilises data centres in other countries for data and infrastructure hosting. This model may be subject to international data transfer restrictions, privacy legislation, and enforcement actions, as mentioned above. Despite this, it may be desirable due to the availability of services, lower cost offerings, and scalability and redundancy features. This model poses significant data sovereignty issues, and users should ensure a comprehensive understanding of legal and security risks before hosting critical or highly sensitive workloads offshore.

### Summarising Appropriate Models for Different Users

The previous section has highlighted several key issues users must consider when determining how and where to host and manage their technology solutions. Four examples below describe key user personas and recommended hosting and management solutions. By carefully evaluating these considerations, each user group can identify the most suitable deployment pattern to meet their unique needs and strategic objectives. The critical role of data centres and technology service providers in supporting these models underscores the importance of investing in advanced infrastructure capable of meeting the demands of modern AI and computing workloads.

- **Individual and Family Users**

  Primary considerations for individuals and families generally include cost, ease of use and data privacy. Users typically seek convenient, multi-device solutions with native security and redundancy features. SaaS offerings such as Google Drive and ChatGPT are often chosen as “default” options for general use. Open-source and self-hosted alternatives are available to those with the technical aptitude or enhanced privacy concerns.

- **Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)**

  Like individuals and families, SMEs often choose solutions that are cost-effective and easy to use. In addition, the ability to rapidly scale without significant capital expenditure provides another reason for SMEs to select popular SaaS offerings. Microsoft’s 365 and Data Fabric products are popular offerings for this segment. Users holding sensitive information, such as customer data, may select SaaS offerings available in New Zealand-hosted data centres to gain some data sovereignty and privacy assurances. In addition, a hybrid deployment approach is often suitable for those with small, sensitive workloads who also wish to benefit from using major SaaS offerings for day-to-day tasks.

- **Large and Complex Businesses**

  Large businesses typically have more complex requirements and larger budgets and employ technology specialists, significantly increasing the ability to customise and control their environment. Key considerations generally include performance, reliability, security, control, and compliance. In addition, users holding sensitive data, including large customer datasets, will place value on sovereignty assurances. For these customers, a hybrid approach, including locally owned and operated co-location facilities for critical workloads, combined with non-core SaaS services such as collaboration tools, offers a strong mix of features that maximise the benefits of local and sovereign hosting whilst offering key productivity benefits of SaaS tools.

- **Government Agencies and Sensitive Industries**

  Government agencies possess large quantities of highly sensitive information, including very large customer datasets, making sovereignty, privacy, and security of paramount importance. Agencies with significant technology requirements will likely justify the overhead of New Zealand-based self-hosted data centres to ensure maximum control and assurance. Agencies with smaller technology footprints will still value domestic control. However, they may elect for locally owned and operated co-location facilities with a large, trusted vendor under a collective government contract.

## The Energy Problem

### Energy Usage and Data Centre Profiles: Traditional Computing vs. AI

The rise of AI is significantly shifting the landscape of data centre demands and energy consumption patterns compared to traditional computing systems. Unlike traditional computing, AI relies on highly specialised processors that demand considerable energy to train models and execute operations.

Traditional computing systems are typically designed to handle various general-purpose tasks such as data processing, transaction management, and running enterprise applications. Energy consumption in conventional data centres is relatively predictable, with fluctuations based on user demand and server load. Systems are often optimised for energy efficiency in standard operational environments.

In contrast, AI computing involves complex algorithms for machine learning, neural networks, and data analytics tasks. AI processes, including model training, are computationally intensive and require substantial energy input. For example, training OpenAI’s 'GPT-3' in 2020 was estimated to cost approximately USD 12 million, resulting in a model with 175 billion parameters and an approximate size of 350 GB. Training a single AI model can consume as much energy as several thousand homes in one day.

AI systems also exhibit a higher power density, which refers to the power used per unit area within the data centre. High-performance processing units essential for AI computations draw more power and generate more heat than traditional computing hardware. The high-power density of AI hardware necessitates more sophisticated cooling solutions to dissipate heat efficiently and maintain system performance. This can involve advanced cooling technologies like liquid or specialised air conditioning systems. AI-driven data centres must be highly scalable and flexible to accommodate the varying intensities of computational workloads and storage needs. This often requires modular data centre designs that can quickly adjust and upgrade as AI technology and demands evolve.

The rise of generative AI technologies has led to an unprecedented demand for data centres equipped to handle more complex tasks than those managed by traditional data centres. Current workloads include large language models and chatbots, but future applications are expected to encompass other resource-intensive tasks such as image and video generation and real-time gaming. AI systems, especially those that involve machine learning and deep learning, require substantial computational power to process large datasets, perform complex calculations, and deliver real-time insights. Data centres, which house the servers and storage systems that enable these computations, thus become pivotal in the operational deployment of AI.

The shift from traditional computing to AI has significant implications for data centre management. As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various sectors, data centres must adapt to these higher energy densities and develop more efficient ways to manage power usage and heat dissipation.

### The Global Scale of AI’s Energy Demands

Periods of notable civilisational progress are often marked by improved efficiency or effectiveness in harnessing energy, leading to increased global energy consumption. The development of AI technologies continues this trend, with its computational demands requiring significant physical resources, a point often overlooked or misunderstood in current discourse.

Over the past five years, the global deployment of AI hardware has surged, significantly altering the energy demands and data centre requirements for computation. As AI applications have become more widespread and complex, the energy consumption of these data centres has become a significant component of electricity grid demand profiles.

AI’s fluctuating energy requirements, resembling a sawtooth graph rather than a smooth curve, can cause more abrupt and severe fluctuations than conventional industrial or residential demands. This irregularity can complicate the management of electricity grids, increasing the risk of instability and potential outages, and necessitate close cooperation between data centre operators and utility providers to mitigate the risk of blackouts and ensure reliable energy distribution. Such dynamics highlight the critical need for enhanced grid management technologies, better forecasting methods, and more robust grid infrastructure, essential for maintaining energy security in the AI era.

Financial projections for the industry are staggering, and many industry leaders are voicing concerns about AI’s energy demands. Microsoft and OpenAI are working on plans for a data centre project that could cost as much as USD 100 billion (NZD 165 billion) with an AI supercomputer called “Stargate”, set to launch in 2028. It is reported that operations like ChatGPT already use over 500,000 kWh per day.

The International Energy Agency notes that data centres and their associated network infrastructures already account for up to 1.5% of global energy usage. Further, by 2026, AI-driven expansion may contribute to doubling global energy usage by data centres, reaching over 800 terawatt-hours (TWh). To put this into perspective, 800 TWh is roughly 18 times the annual electricity production in New Zealand. The CEO of Nvidia agrees, highlighting that we are at a tipping point, predicting a doubling in data centre costs within five years to support burgeoning software demands. In Ireland, a significant global computing hub, data centres are anticipated to consume nearly a third of all national electricity by 2032. The CEO of ARM Holdings stated that AI might account for 20-25% of U.S. power requirements by the decade's end, a significant increase from today's consumption, estimated at 4% or less.

The escalating energy demands of the AI industry not only emphasise the need for increased energy production but also raise significant concerns about energy security. As AI technologies continue to permeate various sectors, their substantial and growing energy requirements could strain existing power infrastructures, particularly in regions already facing supply limitations. This surge in demand may lead to increased competition for energy resources, potentially elevating prices and exacerbating vulnerabilities in energy supply chains. Furthermore, the concentration of AI-driven energy consumption in specific geographic locations, such as North America, intensifies these concerns, as localised demand surges can outpace the available infrastructure's ability to supply energy reliably and sustainably.

Nations that grasp this paradigm of AI utilisation and energy consumption and develop robust strategies to harness these technologies will find a critical window in which they can significantly enhance their living standards and global stature. For New Zealand, leveraging this trend may represent the most significant opportunity for the next generation, especially if it capitalises on its technological and renewable energy capabilities.

**Powering Up with Renewable Energy**

Despite many vocal groups calling for an immediate reduction in hydrocarbon-based energy sources, these are still critical for the security and stability of national grids worldwide. One of the most significant challenges with renewable sources like solar and wind is their variability. The intermittent nature of these sources can lead to reliability issues in supplying constant power, which needs to be mitigated through technologies like energy storage systems. One problem with this is that large-scale batteries are currently expensive and have a significant environmental impact, as well as ethical concerns due to the need for natural resources such as cobalt and lithium.

In addition, initial investment in renewable energy projects often requires significant financial backing, which can be a barrier, especially for larger projects. The financial return on renewable energy investments can be unpredictable and often long-term. This uncertainty can deter investors, particularly in a small market like New Zealand, where energy prices are volatile. Furthermore, approving renewable energy projects can be lengthy and complex, involving numerous environmental checks and community consultations. This can delay project initiation and increase costs. In addition, renewable energy projects often require large physical sites, leading to conflicts over land use, particularly in areas of ecological sensitivity or agricultural value.

**Data Centres as Customers of Energy Companies**

Due to the rapidly growing demand for electricity, data centres, particularly those running highly energy-intensive workloads such as AI training, are becoming critically important to energy companies and grid operators tasked with providing stable, efficient and reliable electricity to the population. Likewise, sourcing cheap and reliable electricity is one of the most foundational aspects of selecting a location for operating a large data centre. The following points describe the growing importance of energy companies and data centre operators collaborating on sophisticated contractual agreements to ensure that introducing new data centre workloads is mutually beneficial.

- **Large Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)**

  A key aspect of improving energy security and increasing renewable energy generation is the role of large Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to de-risk new generation investment. A PPA is a long-term contractual agreement whereby a large-scale electricity buyer, such as a data centre, purchases from a generator at terms agreed in advance, including the volume of electricity to be supplied, pricing, and the duration of the agreement, often 10 to 20 years.

  The benefits of PPAs can be significant to both generators and consumers. Generators receive revenue certainty and diversification away from the spot market. Locked-in revenue is a crucial driver for access to additional project capital and a fundamental enabler of growing generation capacity. For consumers, PPAs can offer the ability to acquire energy at lower rates on average compared to spot market pricing. PPAs can also effectively hedge against cost inflation, giving investors confidence in the long-term profitability of energy-intensive businesses. PPAs are one of the most effective ways to improve long-term energy security in a geographical area, as they can promote increased generation capacity in a risk-minimised way.

  In New Zealand, almost all electricity generation is sold in the wholesale spot market, meaning generators take an increased risk of selling in a market with volatile spot pricing and demand. PPAs are increasingly seen as a significant tool for promoting large-scale renewable energy investments. Data Centre operators are critical counterparties in the PPA market; many of the largest publicly announced deals globally sit with Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Google, and Microsoft.

  For renewable energy generation, which is inherently more volatile due to changes in weather conditions, PPAs with “Demand Response” clauses can significantly compound the benefits of PPAs for energy companies and grid operators.

- **Demand Response in Energy Management**

  Demand response is an essential strategy used in energy management to adjust the power demand, instead of the supply, in times of imbalance. It incentivises consumers to reduce their energy use at peak times or shift consumption to off-peak periods. Large-scale rapid demand response customers reduce the extent to which the grid requires higher cost and less environmentally friendly thermal base-load generation, such as gas, coal, and diesel-powered “peaker plants”, which can be turned on when a supply constraint is expected to reduce the risk of blackouts. Sufficient demand response capacity results in lower base-load cost and better utilisation of renewables through the entire generation curve.

  The “generation curve” describes the quantity of energy produced from renewable sources over time. This fluctuates rapidly, depending on weather conditions and generation type. For example, solar panels cannot generate power for 12-14 hours per day in most areas, and the “shoulder” periods, such as early morning and late afternoon, generate significantly less than peak theoretical capacity. This contrasts with the “demand curve”, which reflects the demand for electricity from all residential, commercial and industrial consumers. This also fluctuates throughout the day and year, with peak demand occurring around 6-8 pm on winter evenings.

  The result of this constant demand and supply imbalance means grid management is a complex business. Grid operators must manage generation, transmission, and distribution 24 hours, 365 days per year, to ensure high reliability for customers in disparate geographical locations, all while minimising wasted or “stranded” energy, i.e., energy that is produced but cannot be consumed or stored, as well as minimising generation from non-renewable and high-cost sources.

  In New Zealand, implementing demand response programs is becoming increasingly important as the country seeks to maximise renewable energy usage and stabilise its grid.

### Bitcoin Mining’s Unique Characteristics and Synergies with AI Data Centre Workloads

Besides the rapid advancement of AI, one of the most significant changes in the Data Centre and Energy sectors in the past five years has been the inclusion of Bitcoin mining as a synergistic workload that can materially improve data centre profitability, efficiency and energy grid operations. This section outlines how integrating Bitcoin mining with renewable energy initiatives and AI data centre operations can create mutual benefits and drive technological and energy advancements.

Bitcoin mining describes the process of expending large quantities of energy to compete in a global network of miners competing to “find” the next block to append to the Bitcoin time chain. Mining is the security mechanism that ensures Bitcoin remains resistant to unauthorised changes to the time chain and is fundamental to the decentralised nature of the protocol. Miners receive rewards in exchange for energy expenditure to secure the network, denominated in the Bitcoin currency. This can be instantaneously converted to New Zealand Dollars or sold on futures derivatives markets to mitigate unwanted asset price volatility.

Bitcoin mining devices are small, modular, specialised computers that consume an extremely large amount of electricity compared to traditional computers and even specialised AI hardware. For comparison, a typical miner, approximately the size of a shoebox, consumes four to nine times more energy than a cutting-edge AI processor running at 100% capacity and more than 3 times more than the average New Zealand household per annum.

Bitcoin mining operations are also geographically agnostic and can be deployed with minimal infrastructure. Co-locating miners within data centres can lead to cost-sharing in infrastructure development, such as buildings, cooling systems and security, reducing the capital and operational expenditures for both setups. Furthermore, integrating Bitcoin mining operations with AI data centres can improve overall load management on the power grid. Operators can optimise the timing and intensity of Bitcoin mining activities based on energy availability, pricing, and the data centre’s operational requirements, promoting more efficient energy use and cost savings.

New Zealand's significant investment in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, often produces surplus energy during periods of low demand. Bitcoin mining operations can utilise this surplus energy, which would otherwise be wasted due to the intermittent nature of renewable sources. While battery production represents one potential avenue for storing excess energy, the extensive extraction of minerals required for batteries, such as lithium and cobalt, results in significant ecological, societal, and environmental burdens. These include habitat destruction, water contamination, and adverse impacts on local communities, compounded by the energy-intensive nature of battery refining and manufacturing processes.

As well as being situated within data centres, many mining solutions can also be deployed in standard shipping containers, meaning they can be dropped off, plugged in (immediately converting electricity to income, without any grid or network infrastructure in place), and relocated as needed. By co-locating Bitcoin mining operations with renewable energy projects, New Zealand can create a symbiotic relationship where excess renewable energy is effectively used, and data centre profitability is enhanced.
